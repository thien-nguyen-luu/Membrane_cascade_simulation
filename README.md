## What is "Membrane cascade simulation" ?
It is a MATLAB application that helps simulate a membrane system. Scientists and engineers can use their own material parameters to calculate actual process performance and estimate process cost.

## How to download?
You can download the software by download the **"Membrane Cascade Simulation.mlappinstall"** in repos.

## How to install ?
It can be installed as an add-on in MATLAB. Follow this link (https://youtu.be/e_3zLQOial8?t=133) to see how.
